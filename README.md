# gossip-protocol


## Problem Definition 
Gossip type algorithms can be used both for group communication and for aggregate computation. The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of such algorithms through a simulator based on actors written in F#. Since actors in F# are fully asynchronous, the particular type of Gossip implemented is the so called Asynchronous Gossip.

### Gossip Algorithm for information propagation 
#### Starting: A participant(actor) it told/sent a roumor(fact) by the main
process
#### Step: Each actor selects a random neighbor and tells it the rumor
#### Termination: Each actor keeps track of rumors and how many times it
has heard the rumor. It stops transmitting once it has heard the rumor
10 times (10 is arbitrary, you can select other values).

### Push-Sum algorithm for sum computation
#### State
Each actor Ai maintains two quantities: s and w. Initially, s = xi = i (that is actor number i has value i, play with other distribution if you so desire) and w = 1
#### Starting
Ask one of the actors to start from the main process.
#### Receive
Messages sent and received are pairs of the form (s, w). Upon receive, an actor should add received pair to its own corresponding values. Upon receive, each actor selects a random neighboor and sends it a message.
#### Send 
When sending a message to another actor, half of s and w is kept by the sending actor and half is placed in the message.
#### Sum estimate
At any given moment of time, the sum estimate is s/w
Where,
s and w are the current values of an actor
#### Termination: 
If an actor's ratio s/w did not change more than 10âˆ’10 in 3 consecutive rounds the actor terminates.

### Topologies 
The actual network topology plays a critical role in the dissemination speed of Gossip protocols. As part of this project you have to experiment with various topologies. The topology determines who is considered a neighboor in the algorithms.
#### Full Network
Every actor is a neighbor of all other actors. That is, every actor can talk directly to any other actor.
#### 2D Grid
Actors form a 2D grid. The actors can only talk to the grid neighbors.
#### Line 
Actors are arranged in a line. Each actor has only 2 neighbors (one left and one right, unless you are the first or last actor).
#### Imperfect 2D Grid 
Grid arrangement but one random other neighbor is selected from the list of all actors (4+1 neighbors).

## Project Requirements
### Input
On the command line:
projectname numNodes topology algorithm
Where:
numNodes is the number of actors involved (for 2D based topologies - rounded up until you we get a square)
Topology is one of full, 2D, line, imp2D
Algorithm is one of gossip, push-sum.

### Output 
The amount of time it took to achieve convergence of the algorithm. 
Time measured using:
... build topology
val b = System.currentTimeMillis;
..... start protocol
println(b-System.currentTimeMillis)
